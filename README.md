**Purpose**

This is a simple Go program that uses stochastic method to approximate the value of pi.


**Organization**

The program takes one input, which is the number of iterations to run. You can modify this value in the source code to adjust the accuracy of the estimate. By default, the program uses 1,000,000 iterations.


**How to run/use**

To install and run the program, follow these steps:

1. Install Go on your computer. You can download it from the official website: https://golang.org/doc/install

2. Clone this repository or download the source code to your computer.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the source code.

4. Run the following command to compile and run the program:

    go run pi.go

5. The program will run and output an estimated value of pi.

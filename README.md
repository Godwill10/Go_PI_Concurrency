**Concurrency in Go**

**Name: Godwill Afolabi**

**Purpose**

This is a simple Go program that uses stochastic method to approximate the value of pi.


**Organization**

The program will then loop through a set of iteration values and use the stochastic method to estimate pi for each iteration. The estimated value of pi, the delta from the true value of pi, and the time taken to perform the calculation will be printed to the console for each iteration.


**How to run/use**

To install and run the program, follow these steps:

1. Install Go on your computer. You can download it from the official website: https://golang.org/doc/install

2. Clone this repository or download the source code to your computer.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the source code.

4. Run the following command to compile and run the program:

    go run pi.go

5. The program will run and output an estimated value of pi.
